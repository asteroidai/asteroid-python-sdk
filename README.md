# Sentinel Python SDK
A Python SDK for interacting with the Sentinel platform.

## Installation
```bash
pip install sentinel-python-sdk
```
  
## Quick Start
```python
import sentinel
# Initialize the SDK
sentinel.init(api_key="your_api_key")
# Use your LLM client as usual
import openai
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
  messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}]
)
print(response)
```

- **API Reference**: Generated using tools like Sphinx or pdoc.
- **Integration Guide**: Detailed steps on integrating the SDK with different clients.
- **Examples Directory**: Contains sample scripts demonstrating various use cases.

## Compatibility

- **Python Versions**: Supports Python 3.7 and above.
- **Operating Systems**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux environments.
- **Environment Considerations**: Ensure network access to `api.sentinel.com`.

## Delivery Format

- **Repository**: Hosted on GitHub at `https://github.com/yourusername/sentinel-python-sdk`.
- **Package Distribution**: Available on PyPI for installation via `pip`.
- **Continuous Integration**: Configured using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

## Next Steps

- **Improve Error Handling**: Add more granular exceptions and retry mechanisms.
- **Implement Async Operations**: Use `asyncio` for non-blocking calls to minimize latency.
- **Caching Mechanism**: Introduce local caching for project and task IDs.
- **Increase Test Coverage**: Write more unit and integration tests to achieve 90% coverage.
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmark the SDK to ensure it meets the 50ms overhead requirement.
